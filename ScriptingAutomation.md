## Shell Scripting Basics

- `bash`
  - The Bourne Again Shell, a popular shell for scripting.
  - Example: `bash script.sh` (executes `script.sh` using `bash`).

- `#!/bin/bash`
  - Shebang line used to specify the script interpreter.
  - Example: `#!/bin/bash` (used at the beginning of a script to indicate it should be run with `bash`).

- `chmod +x`
  - Makes a script executable.
  - Example: `chmod +x script.sh` (sets the executable permission for `script.sh`).

- `echo`
  - Displays a message or variable value.
  - Example: `echo "Hello, World!"` (prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal).

- `read`
  - Reads user input.
  - Example: `read -p "Enter your name: " name` (prompts the user to enter their name).

## Scheduling Tasks

- `cron`
  - A daemon that executes scheduled commands.
  - Example: `crontab -e` (opens the cron table for editing).

- `crontab`
  - Manages cron jobs.
  - Example: `crontab -l` (lists current cron jobs).

- `at`
  - Schedules one-time tasks.
  - Example: `echo "bash script.sh" | at now + 1 minute` (runs `script.sh` in one minute).

- `sleep`
  - Pauses execution for a specified time.
  - Example: `sleep 60` (pauses for 60 seconds).

## Automation Tools

- `expect`
  - Automates interactive applications.
  - Example: `expect script.exp` (executes `script.exp` which automates interactions).

- `sed`
  - Stream editor for modifying text in scripts.
  - Example: `sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt` (replaces `old` with `new` in `file.txt`).

- `awk`
  - A powerful text processing language for scripting.
  - Example: `awk '{print $1}' file.txt` (prints the first field from each line in `file.txt`).

- `find`
  - Searches for files and directories and can execute commands on them.
  - Example: `find . -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;` (finds and deletes all `.log` files).

## Text Processing in Scripts

- `grep`
  - Searches for patterns in files or input streams.
  - Example: `grep "pattern" file.txt` (searches for "pattern" in `file.txt`).

- `cut`
  - Extracts sections from each line of files.
  - Example: `cut -d: -f1 file.txt` (extracts the first field from lines in `file.txt`).

- `sort`
  - Sorts lines of text files.
  - Example: `sort file.txt` (sorts lines in `file.txt`).

- `tr`
  - Translates or deletes characters.
  - Example: `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt` (converts all lowercase letters to uppercase).

## Error Handling and Debugging

- `set -e`
  - Exits the script if any command fails.
  - Example: `set -e` (add to the script to stop on errors).

- `set -x`
  - Enables debugging mode to print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
  - Example: `set -x` (shows command traces during execution).

- `trap`
  - Executes commands when a script receives a signal.
  - Example: `trap 'echo "An error occurred"; exit 1' ERR` (executes on error).

## Conclusion

Scripting and automation improve efficiency and consistency in task management. For more detailed usage and options, refer to the respective commandâ€™s manual page (e.g., `man bash` or `man crontab`).

Happy scripting!
