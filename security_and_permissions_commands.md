## File Permissions

- `chmod`
  - Changes file permissions.
  - Example: `chmod 755 file.txt` (sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for others).

- `chown`
  - Changes file owner and group.
  - Example: `chown user:group file.txt` (changes the owner of `file.txt` to `user` and the group to `group`).

- `chgrp`
  - Changes group ownership of a file.
  - Example: `chgrp group file.txt` (changes the group of `file.txt` to `group`).

- `umask`
  - Sets default permission mask for new files and directories.
  - Example: `umask 022` (sets the default permissions for new files to `644` and directories to `755`).

## User and Group Management

- `useradd`
  - Adds a new user to the system.
  - Example: `useradd username` (creates a new user `username`).

- `usermod`
  - Modifies user account properties.
  - Example: `usermod -aG group username` (adds `username` to `group`).

- `userdel`
  - Deletes a user account.
  - Example: `userdel username` (deletes the user `username`).

- `groupadd`
  - Adds a new group to the system.
  - Example: `groupadd groupname` (creates a new group `groupname`).

- `groupdel`
  - Deletes a group.
  - Example: `groupdel groupname` (deletes the group `groupname`).

## System Security

- `sudo`
  - Executes commands with superuser privileges.
  - Example: `sudo command` (runs `command` as the superuser).

- `passwd`
  - Changes user passwords.
  - Example: `passwd username` (changes the password for `username`).

- `sudoers`
  - Configures user privileges for `sudo` (requires editing `/etc/sudoers`).
  - Example: `visudo` (opens the sudoers file for editing).

- `pkill`
  - Sends signals to processes based on name.
  - Example: `pkill -9 processname` (forcefully terminates `processname`).

- `kill`
  - Sends signals to processes by PID.
  - Example: `kill -9 1234` (forcefully terminates the process with PID `1234`).

## Network Security

- `iptables`
  - Configures network packet filtering rules.
  - Example: `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT` (allows incoming SSH connections on port 22).

- `nmap`
  - Scans networks for open ports and services (requires installation).
  - Example: `nmap 192.168.1.1` (scans the IP address `192.168.1.1` for open ports).

- `ufw`
  - Manages a firewall (requires installation).
  - Example: `ufw enable` (enables the firewall).

- `ssh`
  - Securely connects to remote systems over SSH.
  - Example: `ssh user@hostname` (connects to `hostname` as `user`).

## File Integrity

- `md5sum`
  - Computes and verifies MD5 checksums.
  - Example: `md5sum file.txt` (computes the MD5 checksum of `file.txt`).

- `sha256sum`
  - Computes and verifies SHA-256 checksums.
  - Example: `sha256sum file.txt` (computes the SHA-256 checksum of `file.txt`).

- `tripwire`
  - Monitors file integrity (requires installation and configuration).
  - Example: `tripwire --check` (checks file integrity against a database).

## Conclusion

Managing security and permissions is crucial for protecting your system and data. For more detailed usage and options, refer to the respective commandâ€™s manual page (e.g., `man chmod` or `man iptables`).

Stay secure!
