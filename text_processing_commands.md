## Basic Text Processing Commands

- `cat`
  - Concatenates and displays file contents.
  - Example: `cat file.txt` (displays the contents of `file.txt`).

- `tac`
  - Displays file contents in reverse order.
  - Example: `tac file.txt` (shows the contents of `file.txt` from bottom to top).

- `head`
  - Displays the first part of a file.
  - Example: `head -n 10 file.txt` (shows the first 10 lines of `file.txt`).

- `tail`
  - Displays the last part of a file.
  - Example: `tail -n 10 file.txt` (shows the last 10 lines of `file.txt`).

## Text Searching

- `grep`
  - Searches for patterns in files.
  - Example: `grep "pattern" file.txt` (searches for "pattern" in `file.txt`).

- `egrep`
  - Extended `grep` for extended regular expressions.
  - Example: `egrep "pattern1|pattern2" file.txt` (searches for `pattern1` or `pattern2`).

- `fgrep`
  - Searches for fixed strings (no regular expressions).
  - Example: `fgrep "string" file.txt` (searches for the fixed string "string" in `file.txt`).

- `find`
  - Finds files and directories based on criteria.
  - Example: `find /path -name "*.txt"` (finds all `.txt` files in `/path`).

## Text Manipulation

- `cut`
  - Removes sections from each line of files.
  - Example: `cut -d: -f1 file.txt` (extracts the first field from lines in `file.txt`, using `:` as a delimiter).

- `paste`
  - Merges lines of files.
  - Example: `paste file1.txt file2.txt` (combines lines from `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` side by side).

- `sort`
  - Sorts lines of text files.
  - Example: `sort file.txt` (sorts lines in `file.txt`).

- `uniq`
  - Removes duplicate lines from a sorted file.
  - Example: `uniq file.txt` (removes duplicate lines from `file.txt`, assuming itâ€™s sorted).

- `tr`
  - Translates or deletes characters.
  - Example: `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt` (converts all lowercase letters to uppercase in `file.txt`).

## Text Formatting

- `awk`
  - A powerful text processing language.
  - Example: `awk '{print $1}' file.txt` (prints the first field from each line of `file.txt`).

- `sed`
  - A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
  - Example: `sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt` (replaces all occurrences of `old` with `new` in `file.txt`).

- `fmt`
  - Simple text formatter for wrapping text.
  - Example: `fmt file.txt` (wraps lines in `file.txt` to a default width).

- `column`
  - Formats text into columns.
  - Example: `column -t file.txt` (formats `file.txt` into a table).

## Advanced Text Processing

- `xargs`
  - Constructs argument lists and executes commands.
  - Example: `find . -name "*.log" | xargs rm` (finds all `.log` files and deletes them).

- `diff`
  - Compares files line by line.
  - Example: `diff file1.txt file2.txt` (shows differences between `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`).

- `comm`
  - Compares two sorted files line by line.
  - Example: `comm file1.txt file2.txt` (shows lines common to both files, and unique lines in each file).

## Conclusion

These commands are essential for effective text processing and manipulation in Termux. For more detailed usage and options, refer to the respective command's manual page (e.g., `man grep` or `man awk`).

Happy text processing!
